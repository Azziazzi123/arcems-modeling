        <h2>Lab Engineer III</h2>
        <p>Mr. Salim Lateef is a dedicated Lab Engineer III who joined the Center for Environment & Marine Studies, Research Institute, KFUPM in August 2023. He is an integral member of the Environmental Modeling Group, focusing on oil spill modeling and sediment dispersion modeling for the center's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) projects. He actively collaborates with multidisciplinary groups to enhance project outcomes.</p>
        <p>Salim holds a master’s degree in environmental sciences from UTU, Dehradun, India, and a PG Diploma in Remote Sensing and GIS from the University of Kashmir. He demonstrates his commitment to professional development through active participation in workshops and conferences. Notably, he has presented a paper on Flood Damage Assessment using Geospatial Technology at the 1st International Conference on Innovations in Science and Humanities. He has also presented a paper at the National Symposium on Innovations in Geospatial Technology for Sustainable Development, with a special emphasis on NER (North-eastern Region). He has attended a workshop at IIRS Dehradun in 2010 and is a lifetime member of the Indian Society of Geomatics.</p>
        <p>With expertise in Digital Image Processing, Geographical Information System (GIS), Urban Mapping & Planning, Tourism Mapping & Planning, Hydrology modeling, and Remote Sensing applications in Disaster Management, Earth, and Environmental Science, Salim brings valuable skills to his role. His four years of research experience in the fields of Earth and Environmental Science, GIS, and Remote Sensing have enriched his knowledge and capabilities.</p>
        <p>Salim has a strong background in various areas related to his field. He has worked on Environmental Impact Assessment projects and has contributed significantly to the EIA studies. Additionally, he has hands-on experience in Hydrology and Water Quality Analysis. This includes delineating groundwater potential zoning in Srinagar and Pulwama using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and GIS techniques, as well as conducting water demand and supply analysis using modeling approaches. Salim has also executed Soil Chemical Analysis and Land Capability Analysis projects, which involved assessing soil health in the upper Jhelum basin, preparing soil samples for delta C-13 and XRF analysis, and conducting land suitability analysis for agriculture and horticulture using GIS and AHP methodologies.</p>
        <p>As a team player, he collaborates effectively with colleagues and actively contributes to achieving project goals. His proficiency in modeling software, including MIKE modeling software, further enhances his capabilities in Environmental Modeling. Salim Lateef's expertise, experience, and dedication make him an asset to the Environmental Modeling Group, where he consistently delivers high-quality work and contributes.</p>
