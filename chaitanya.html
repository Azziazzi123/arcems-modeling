        <h2>Environmental Engineer III</h2>
        <p>Dr. Venkata Sai Chaitanya Akurathi joined as Environmental Engineer III in August 2023 in the Center for Environment & Marine Studies (ARCEMS) at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. As part of the Modeling Group, he is involved in setting up model environment files for EIA project study areas, running oil and sediment spill transport model simulations, analyzing initial results, and preparing maps and reports. He actively contributes to the modeling components of three EIA projects and works on final project reports.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Dr. Venkata is working on the NEMO-PISCES coupled biogeochemical ocean model setup in AL FAHD HPC to analyze climatic influences on interannual and decadal environmental variability in the Arabian Gulf. He also contributes to preprocessing and preparing air dispersion modeling simulations. His expertise spans numerical ocean and atmospheric models like NEMO-GCM, ROMS, MIKE, Delft3D, CALPUFF, AERMOD, CadnaA, and Lagrangian particle tracking techniques. He is proficient in programming languages including MATLAB, FORTRAN, Python, IDL, and Octave.</p>
        <p>Dr. Venkata earned his Ph.D. in Marine Science from Bharathidasan University, India. He holds a master’s degree in Physical Oceanography from Andhra University, India, and a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. During his academic career, he studied atmospheric and ocean processes and applied numerical modeling techniques. His prior experience includes working at CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa, India, where he focused on surface thermo-haline stratification variations under the Indian-XBT project and participated in various oceanographic observation campaigns.</p>
        <p>He also worked as a Scientific Assistant at the Indo-French Cell for Water Sciences (IFCWS), IISc, Bangalore, where he collected and analyzed seawater samples for extracting uranium and barium concentrations and isotopic signatures using ICPMS and MC-ICPMS. He used End Member Mixing Analysis (EMMA) to examine source contributions of low-salinity waters.</p>
        <p>Dr. Venkata was awarded a two-year Indo-French (IRD-ARTS) Ph.D. grant by IRD, France, to pursue his Ph.D. objectives in collaboration with LOCEAN, Paris, France. During his 18-month tenure at LOCEAN, he worked on numerical ocean-atmosphere coupled modeling to understand air-sea interactions and freshwater source contributions over the Bay of Bengal. He also used the Lagrangian particle tracking method in SPASSO software to trace the origin and pathways of freshwater sources.</p>
        <p>Dr. Venkata has presented his research work at national and international conferences and published nine research articles in reputed journals, including *BAMS*, *JGR*, *Ocean Dynamics*, and *Deep Sea Research*. His work has been recognized with institutional best paper awards.</p>
