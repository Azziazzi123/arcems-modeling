        <h2>Marine Scientist III</h2>
        <p>Mr. Abdul Azeez Saleem joined as Marine Scientist III in August 2023 in the Applied Center for Environment & Marine Studies, Research Institute, KFUPM. His current endeavors predominantly center around the intricacies of oil spill modeling, sediment dispersion modeling, air dispersion modeling, and noise modeling, particularly in the context of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) projects conducted by the center. Additionally, he actively engages in collaborative initiatives across various disciplines with other research groups.</p>
        <p>In 2017, Mr. Abdul Azeez Saleem earned his M.Phil in Ecological Informatics, a field equivalent to Physics, from Cochin University of Science and Technology. His academic background also includes a Bachelor's degree in Physics and a Master's degree in Space Science and Technology. Mr. Azeez's research interests revolve around numerical modeling, specifically in the domains of rivers, estuaries, coastal waters, and open oceans. Additionally, he possesses expertise in remote sensing. Notably, Mr. Azeez has conducted innovative and impactful studies focused on the physical dynamics and modeling of estuarine and coastal processes.</p>
        <p>Prior to his current position, Mr. Azeez served as a Project Associate at the National Institute of Oceanography, India, from February 2018 to February 2023. During this period, he gained extensive experience in numerical modeling and remote sensing. He also collaborated with the *Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici* (CMCC) in Italy, where he worked on advanced numerical modeling techniques and climate change impact studies. While at CMCC, Mr. Azeez contributed to groundbreaking work on extracting bathymetry using satellite imagery, a technique that utilizes remote sensing data to derive underwater topography. This work significantly enhanced the understanding of coastal and marine environments and supported modeling studies in data-scarce regions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Azeez possesses proficiency in various data processing software and programming languages. His skill set includes mastery of tools such as MATLAB, FERRET, ODV, QGIS, ARCGIS, and ERDAS, showcasing his versatility in handling diverse data processing and analysis tasks. This broad range of technical capabilities further enriches his ability to contribute effectively to the complexities of environmental research and modeling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Azeez has established a notable publication record, with approximately 14 research articles in the field of modeling and observational oceanography. His contributions have garnered significant recognition through citations. Additionally, he has been honored with two best paper presentation awards at CIBA-BRAQCON-2019 and OSICON-2021. The primary focus of Mr. Azeez's research lies in the integration of coupled numerical ocean modeling to enhance our understanding of hydrodynamics and associated environmental dynamics in both coastal and open ocean environments.</p>
