        <h2>Group Leader, Research Engineer III</h2>
        <p>Dr. Jiya Albert is currently employed as Research Engineer III at the Applied Research Center for Environment and Marine Studies (ARCEMS) at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. In her role, she manages and leads the modeling-related tasks of client-funded projects, from planning and designing modeling simulations to writing and reviewing reports. She heads the Environmental Modeling Group of ARCEMS, supervising the complete numerical modeling section of the center’s projects and research activities. Additionally, she contributes to preparing detailed technical and commercial proposals, showcasing her strong analytical and communication skills.</p>
        <p>Under her supervision, the center has completed four first-ever in-house modeling studies of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and monitoring projects, highlighting her experience and commitment to environmental modeling research. Her research primarily focuses on oil spill modeling, air dispersion, noise pollution, water quality, and sediment dispersion modeling in relation to EIA projects and multi-disciplinary collaborations. She currently guides a post-doctoral candidate at the center.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albert received her Ph.D. in Ocean Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India. She also holds a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and a master's degree in ocean technology. Her research interests include atmospheric and ocean modeling and the impact of climate change on atmospheric and ocean processes. She has carried out groundbreaking studies on tropical cyclone detection and modeling, including the development of a unique tracker method and algorithm for early detection of cyclogenesis in the Indian Ocean region. Her work has been praised by India's Press Information Bureau and the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India.</p>
        <p>Previously, Dr. Albert was associated with the coastal modeling group under the Ministry of Environment, Forestry, and Climate Change's Sustainable Coastal Management Centre (NCSCM) and DST's Climate Change Project. She contributed to significant central government projects such as the ‘GCRF-South Asia Nitrogen Hub Project (SA-NH)’ and the ‘Assessment of Coastal Erosion and Recommendation for Sufficient Interventions in Green Coastal Infrastructure’ project.</p>
        <p>She has demonstrated expertise in atmospheric models such as Weather Research & Forecast Model (WRF, WRF-Chem), ocean models like MIKE, Advanced Circulation Model (ADCIRC), DELFT3D, Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN), air dispersion models like CALPUFF and AERMOD, and noise pollution models such as CadnaA (Computer Aided Noise Abatement). Additionally, she is proficient in programming languages and modeling software.</p>
        <p>Her peer-reviewed publications, including book chapters in high-impact journals, endorse her expertise in numerical modeling. Her work spans areas such as coastal wave dynamics, atmospheric dynamics and circulation, nutrient flow, and sediment transport budgeting induced by climate change phenomena.</p>
