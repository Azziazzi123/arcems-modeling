        <h2>Post-Doctoral Fellow</h2>
        <p>Dr. Muhammad Shafeeque joined as Post-Doctoral Fellow in September 2023 at the Applied Center for Environment & Marine Studies, Research Institute, KFUPM, KSA. His current research primarily focuses on “Biophysical coupling and Chlorophyll-a variability in the Arabian Gulf and Red Sea: An integrated approach using remote sensing and modeling.” He actively collaborates with multidisciplinary research groups to enhance project outcomes.</p>
        <p>Dr. Shafeeque is a seasoned Physical Oceanographer with over ten years of experience, including his doctoral research at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT), Kochi, India. He holds a Master’s degree in Oceanography and a Bachelor’s degree in Physics. Throughout his career, he has worked at prestigious institutions such as the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE), and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Chennai. He has also collaborated with renowned international institutions, including the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, UK, and the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center, Norway.</p>
        <p>Dr. Shafeeque’s expertise spans data processing, software applications, and numerical modeling. His research interests include physical processes and biological implications, phytoplankton phenology, long-term trends, climate change, bio-optical properties, and extreme weather events. Recently, he has gained proficiency in using the MIKE model for oil spill and sediment transport studies.</p>
        <p>He is proficient in various programming languages and data processing tools such as FORTRAN, FERRET, R, Python, ODV, QGIS, and SeaDAS. His work is supported by advanced knowledge of Linux and Windows operating systems.
